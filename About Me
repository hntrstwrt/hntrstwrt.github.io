I am a sophomore at Eugene Lang College â€” The New School for Liberal Arts in New York City. I am double majoring in the New School's Journalism + Design & Urban Studies programs with a minor in psychology. 

I was born and raised in Portland, Ore., and have held various internships and positions in the journalism and communications industries. I have also won several awards for reporting on stories that range from mental illness in public schools and unjust school district policies. 

I am currently undecided on my career path, however I know it will be in the communications, journalism and/or community health fields. Watching Portland change so severely throughout my lifetime sparked my interest in urban studies and growing up a queer black woman in the whitest town in America led me to speaking out through journalism. 
I have every intent to continue speaking out and learning so that I can better prepare and support the next generation of journalists/social activists.
